# angular-PathFinder
The Path Finder game app developed using angular4

I have Angular 4 for developing the UI and also Lite Server as a static file server to serve the requests.
This requires Angular libarires and Node to be present on the machine to work.

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to to build and run this application.

Get it now if it's not already installed on your machine.
Verify that you are running at least node v4.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors.


Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:
Run the command file - install.cmd

Running the App and Start to Play
Download the repository or clone it on to your machine
Now run the corresponding cmd file launch the browser of your choice
1. start-chrome.cmd : will launch Google Chrome
2. start-firefox.cmd : will launch Firefox
3. start-ie.cmd : will launch Internet Explorer


Framework of Choice
Here I have used Angular 4 as the Javascript framework to develop UI becasue of the following reasons
1. The databinding support in Angular makes data and UI interactions very easy
2. The support for Typescript helps to develop Javascript projects in a Â´n Object Oriented way
3. The Ahead of Time compilation helps the bundle siye to be minimal and also provides high throughput as the compilation in browser will not happen
4. The usage of NgModules helps us to create Enterprise apps in a modular way
5. The components and Services are aimed to provide high level of reusability
6. The concept of Dependency Injection to inject services to components helps in inversion of control and to test components without real dependencies
